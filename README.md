# Hello, I'm Mary Amanuel üëãüèæ

I'm a data analyst based in London, UK. Currently, I work across the data engineering, economics, and analytics teams at the [NHSX Analytics Unit](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/nhsx-analytics-unit/ "Analytics Unit Homepage") to help drive the digital transformation of health and social care.

## :ocean: Recent Projects 
### [NHS App Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/nhsx/nhs-app-analytics-dashboard) 
The dashboard enables those working in the health and care system to monitor the adoption and uptake of the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-app/). We've also improved accessibility so that more people can benefit from the value inside the dashboard.

### [NHS Python Community](https://nhs-pycom.net/)
The NHS Python Community (NHS.pycom) is an open and user-led community that champions the use of python and open code in the NHS and healthcare.
